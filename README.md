## 📖 About This Project : Inventory tracker
I created an Inventory tracking desktop application using Java OOP and MVC principals and JavaFX. I also used  Scenebuilder to create a GUI mock-up. In this app, I used a scenario where a small manifacturing company uses this app to track its inventory. The users can add, modify and delete parts from their inventory. Products can also be  added, modified and deleted from the inventory . Users can search parts and products by name or ID number.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
